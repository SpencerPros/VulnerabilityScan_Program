<h1>Vulnerability Scan Program</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
This program demonstrates my ability to be able to run a simple vulnerability scan that will scan a range of ports on my local address to see if they are open and then relay the results to me to see if any in the range I chose are open or not. You could use this on a different network but for ethical purposes im using it on my local address. Using this program and TryHackMe.com im trying to work towards a tougher program that can demonstrate further how I can keep security integrity in ones network.
